- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I enjoyed implementing Inheritance. I thought it was slightly confusing at first and it took me a few tries to get the syntax correct, but once I figured it out I got the hang of it pretty easily. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This worked pretty smoothly, I would definitely recommend referencing the class examples to understand the syntax and the concepts.
